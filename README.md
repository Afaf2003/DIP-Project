# Object Tracking with OpenCV

This project demonstrates object tracking using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library. It provides a simple Python script that allows you to track objects in a video file using different tracking algorithms available in OpenCV.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (version 3.4.2 or higher recommended)
- NumPy (usually bundled with OpenCV)

## Installation

1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) if you haven't already.
2. Install OpenCV and NumPy using pip:
    ```
    pip install opencv-python-headless numpy
    ```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Afaf2003/Object-Tracker.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd Object-Tracker
    ```

3. Run the Python script with the following command:

    ```
    python main.py
    ```
